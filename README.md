## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 2**: (5 points) Instead of Glitch, host your site on a different service like Heroku or Digital Ocean. Make sure to describe this a bit in your README. What was better about using the service you chose as compared to Glitch? What (if anything) was worse?

- **Tech Achievement 3**: Got 100% in all four lighthouse tests required for this assignment.
